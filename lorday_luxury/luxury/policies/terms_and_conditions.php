				THE LORDAY LUXURY SERVICES & ALL INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS,
				PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) & OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR

				REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO
				THE OPERATION OF THE LORDAY LUXURY SERVICES, OR THE INFORMATION,

				INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE

			</p>

			<h1 class="w3-large w3-light-grey">Disputes</h1>
			<p>
				You expressly agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to
				your use of any Lorday Luxury Service, or to any products or services
				sold or distributed by Lorday Luxury or through Lorday Luxury will be
				resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you
				may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. You
				expressly waive any other jurisdiction for a dispute related to any
				Lorday Luxury Service & any products or services sold or distributed
				by Lorday Luxury or through Lorday Luxury.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is no judge or jury in arbitration, & court review of an
				arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an
				individual basis the same damages & relief as a court (including
				injunctive & declaratory relief or statutory damages), & must
				follow the terms of these Terms & Conditions as a court would.
			</p>
			<p>
				Lorday Luxury will not seek attorneys fees & costs in arbitration
				unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may
				choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on
				written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at
				another mutually agreed location.
			</p>
			<p>
				We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be
				conducted only on an individual basis & not in a class, consolidated
				or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court
				rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.
				We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin
				infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
			</p>

				also govern your use of Lorday Luxury Services. We reserve the right
				to make changes to our site, policies, Service Terms, & these Terms

				Services will evidence your acceptance of those changes. If any of
				these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason
				unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable & shall not
				affect the validity & enforceability of any remaining condition.
