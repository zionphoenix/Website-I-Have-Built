			</p>

			<h1 class="w3-large w3-light-grey">What Personal Information About Customers Does Lorday Gaming Gather?</h1>
			<p>
				The information we learn from customers helps us personalise &
				continually improve your shopping experience at Lorday Gaming. We use
				the information to handle orders, deliver products & services,
				process payments, communicate with you about orders, products,
				services & promotional offers, update our records & generally
				maintain your accounts with us, display content such as customer
				reviews & recommend merchandise & services that might be of
				interest to you. We also use this information to improve our store
				& platform, prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our website &
				enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other
				functions on our behalf.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here are the types of information we gather:
			</p>
			<p style="text-decoration:underline;">
				Information You Give Us
			</p>
			<p>
				We receive & store any information you enter on our website or give
				us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain
				information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many
				of our features. We use the information that you provide for such
				purposes as responding to your requests, customising future shopping
				for you, improving our stores, & communicating with you.
			</p>
			<p style="text-decoration:underline;">
				Automatic Information
			</p>
			<p>
				We receive & store certain types of information whenever you
				interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies,"
				& we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser
				accesses Lorday Gaming or advertisements & other content served by
				or on behalf of Lorday Gaming on other websites.
			</p>
			<p style="text-decoration:underline;">
				Mobile
			</p>
			<p>
				When you download or use apps created by Lorday Gaming or our
				subsidiaries, we may receive information about your location & your
				mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device. We may
				use this information to provide you with location-based services, such
				as advertising, search results, & other personalised content. Most
				mobile devices allow you to turn off location services.
			</p>
			<p style="text-decoration:underline;">
				E-mail Communications
			</p>
			<p>
				To help us make e-mails more useful & interesting, we often receive
				a confirmation when you open e-mail from Lorday Gaming if your
				computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list
				to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending
				unnecessary messages to our customers.
			</p>
			<p style="text-decoration:underline;">
				Information from Other Sources
			</p>
			<p>
				We might receive information about you from other sources & add it
				to our account information.
			</p>

			<h1 class="w3-large w3-light-grey">What About Cookies?</h1>
			<p>
				To enable our systems to recognise your device & to provide features
				to you, we use cookies. For more information about cookies & how we
				use them, please read our Cookies Policy.
			</p>

			<h1 class="w3-large w3-light-grey">Does Lorday Gaming Share the Information It Receives?</h1>
			<p>
				Information about our customers is an important part of our Gaming
				& we are not in the Gaming of selling it to others. Lorday Gaming
				shares customer information only as described below. They are all
				subject to this Privacy Policy & thoroughly follow practices
				protective as those previously described.
			</p>
			<p style="text-decoration:underline;">
				Third-Party Service Providers
			</p>
			<p>
				We employ other companies & individuals to perform functions on our
				behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages,
				sending postal mail & e-mail, removing repetitive information from
				customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance,
				providing search results & links (including paid listings &
				links), processing credit card payments & providing customer
				service. They have access to personal information needed to perform
				their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they
				must process the personal information in accordance with this Privacy
				Policy & as permitted by applicable data protection laws.
			</p>
			<p style="text-decoration:underline;">
				Gaming Transfers
			</p>
			<p>
				As we continue to develop our Gaming, we might sell or buy stores,
				subsidiaries or Gaming units. In such transactions, customer
				information generally is one of the transferred Gaming assets but
				remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy
				Policy (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also,
				in the unlikely event that Lorday Gaming or substantially all of its
				assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of
				the transferred assets.
			</p>
			<p style="text-decoration:underline;">
				Protection of Lorday Gaming & Others
			</p>
			<p>
				We release account & other personal information when we believe
				release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our
				Terms & Conditions & other agreements; or protect the rights,
				property or safety of Lorday Gaming, our users or others. This
				includes exchanging information with other companies & organisations
				for fraud protection & credit risk reduction. Obviously, however,
				this does not include selling, renting, sharing or otherwise
				disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for
				commercial purposes in a way that is contrary to the commitments made
				in this Privacy Policy.
			</p>
			<p style="text-decoration:underline;">
				With Your Consent
			</p>
			<p>
				Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information
				about you might go to third parties, & you will have an opportunity
				to choose not to share the information. Whenever we transfer personal
				information, we will ensure that the information is transferred in
				accordance with this Privacy Policy & as permitted by the applicable
				laws on data protection.
			</p>

			<h1 class="w3-large w3-light-grey">How Secure Is Information About Me?</h1>
			<p>
				We work to protect the security of your information during
				transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which
				encrypts information you input. We reveal only the last four digits
				of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we
				transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card
				company during order processing. We maintain physical, electronic &
				procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage &
				disclosure of personally identifiable customer information. Our
				security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of
				identity before we disclose personal information to you. It is
				important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your
				password & to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished
				using a shared computer.

				similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by
