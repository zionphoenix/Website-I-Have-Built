			<h1 class="w3-large w3-light-grey">DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES & LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h1>
			<p>
				THE LORDAY RESUME SERVICES & ALL INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS,
				PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) & OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR
				OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE LORDAY RESUME SERVICES
				ARE PROVIDED BY LORDAY RESUME ON AN "AS IS" & "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS,
				UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING. LORDAY RESUME MAKES NO
				REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO
				THE OPERATION OF THE LORDAY RESUME SERVICES, OR THE INFORMATION,
				CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES
				INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE
				LORDAY RESUME SERVICES, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING. YOU
				EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE LORDAY RESUME SERVICES IS AT
				YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW,
				LORDAY RESUME DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
				BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY & FITNESS
				FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. LORDAY RESUME DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE
				LORDAY RESUME SERVICES, INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS
				(INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE

				SERVERS OR ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS SENT FROM LORDAY RESUME ARE FREE

				LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM THE USE OF ANY
				LORDAY RESUME SERVICE, OR FROM ANY INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS,
				PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR

			</p>
			<p>
				CERTAIN LAWS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE
				EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO
				YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS
				MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, & YOU MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS. HOWEVER,

			</p>

			<h1 class="w3-large w3-light-grey">Disputes</h1>
			<p>
				You expressly agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to
				your use of any Lorday Resume Service, or to any products or services
				sold or distributed by Lorday Resume or through Lorday Resume will be
				resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you
				may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. You
				expressly waive any other jurisdiction for a dispute related to any
				Lorday Resume Service & any products or services sold or distributed
				by Lorday Resume or through Lorday Resume.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is no judge or jury in arbitration, & court review of an
				arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an
				individual basis the same damages & relief as a court (including
				injunctive & declaratory relief or statutory damages), & must
				follow the terms of these Terms & Conditions as a court would.
			</p>
			<p>
				Lorday Resume will not seek attorneys fees & costs in arbitration
				unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may
				choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on
				written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at
				another mutually agreed location.
			</p>
			<p>
				We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be
				conducted only on an individual basis & not in a class, consolidated
				or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court
				rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.
				We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin
				infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
			</p>

			<h1 class="w3-large w3-light-grey">Policies, Modification, & Sever-ability</h1>
			<p>
				Please review our other policies posted on this site. These policies
				also govern your use of Lorday Resume Services. We reserve the right
				to make changes to our site, policies, Service Terms, & these Terms
				& Conditions at any time & your continued use of the Lorday Resume
				Services will evidence your acceptance of those changes. If any of
				these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason
				unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable & shall not
				affect the validity & enforceability of any remaining condition.
