    <p>In order to conduct this experiment, 400 test subjects were examined.
      100 individuals for each experimental group: Document Resume Owner;
      Document Resume Owner with Continual Updating; Website Resume Owner; &
      Website Resume Owner with Continual Updating. The results are further based
      on meta-analysis which aided the results of this experiment.

      Within a span of ten years, a document resume owner did not manage to
      progress their career in any way. We asked these individualâ€™s employers
      why they chose not to promote these employees within their companies.
      Their response was focused around how these employees, though loyal, &
      efficient to the best of their abilities, did not seem to be willing to
      receive more responsibility & were perfectly content despite having been
      consulted with, for potential progression within the company, showcased
      within their choice of resume.

  <div class="w3-center">
    <p>
      Whereas a document resume owner, who continually updated
      their resume, managed to progress their career once in heirarchy. The
      individuals employers response was focused around how these employees,
      were very hard-working, & were more than willing to take on more
      responsibility. Except they lacked discipline in honing their professional image,
      as the further the progression within the company, the more the individual
      stood to represent the company, & thus interception from the company was
      required, in offering courses, workshops, & further enhancement services,
      which hindered their career progression.

  <div class="w3-center">
    <p>
      Website resume owners, on the other hand, managed to progress
      their career four times in heirarchy steadily within a time period of ten
      years. The employers of whom,
      responded by stating how these employees always seemed to go above & beyond
      within their work ethic & for their surrounding colleagues, with their website resume
      playing great evidence of their willingess to invest in others, & themselves.

    <p>
      Finally, website resume owners who continually updated
      their resume managed to progress their career six times in heirarchy steadily.
      With their employers focusing around how these employees always
      seemed to be looking for ways to better their professionalism, by
      undertaking courses, always looking to do more, & to be more, & thus were
      very willing to be their absolute best, which transcended into their work
      ethic, & made them exceptional candidates, for higher positions within
      any company. This led to such individuals being constantly head-hunted, which then led to
      a yearly increase in salary, amongst a myriad of incentives being put in place,
      in order to keep such excellent employees, & further mold them into executives,
      who would go onto potentially run continental divisions of the company!

    <p class="w3-large">Conclusion</p>
    <p>In conclusion, having a website resume which is continually updated
      elicits exponential career progression, by up to six roles higher in
      hierarchy within a time period of ten years, whereas simply having a
      website resume, also elicits a greater
      increase in career progression, by up to four roles higher in hierarchy.
      Document resumes were found to be, in comparison, relatively ineffective,
      in causing career progression, given the state of their resume, leading to
      the individuals professional image being compromised, which affected the
      companys consideration of progressing the individual further.
