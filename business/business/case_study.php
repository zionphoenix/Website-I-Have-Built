      Over a five year period, an aggregate of eight & a half million dollars
      ( $8,396,794.00 ) was made by these companies. In the first year, about
      half a million dollars ( $530,064.00 ) was held as the average, whereas
      in the second year, this statistic rose by 217% ( $1,153,246.00 ),
      surpassing the seven-figure threshold within two short years! In the third
      year, a rise in revenue continued, with an average return of close to two
      million dollars ( $1,986,420.00 ). The fourth year yielded a return of well
      over two million dollars ( $2,235,790.00 ), with the fifth year drawing
      results surpassing two & a half million dollars ( $2,523,685.00 ). The
      plateau in revenue, from years three to five, is largely attributed to a
      large number of business owners branching off into other businesses,
      limiting growth for this subsidiary, of their, now, empire, which is
      ultimately the goal of this business model.

      The first month averaged a return of $4,976.00, followed by $9,982.00 in
      the second month, with $15,125.00 being generated in the third month,
      totalling $30,083.00 in revenue for the first quarter. This trend was
      followed by an exponential increase in earnings, following the recommended
      attainment of a location, for a point of operation. Thus the fourth month
      held a $29,785.00 return rate, followed by a $34,233.00 fifth month, with
      the sixth month eliciting $40,846.00, generating a $104,864.00 second
      quarter. Revenue continued to increase in the seventh month where
      $45,186.00 was made, followed by a $50,834.00 eighth month, ending with a
      $59,145.00 ninth month, totalling a $155,165.00 third quarter. Finally, a
      $69,963.00 tenth month, $79,785.00 eleventh month, & a $90,204.00 twelfth
      month, generated a grand total of $239,952.00 in the fourth quarter.

      The first quarter generated $30,083.00 in revenue, followed by a 349%
      increase in earnings ( $104,864.00 ) in the second quarter, creating a
      total of $134,947.00 within the first six months of operation. This
      exponential increase in revenue continued with a $155,165.00 third
      quarter, & a $239,952.00 fourth quarter, which when compared with the
      first quarter differed by 516% & 798% respectively. This continuation in
      success accumulated to a 293% increase in semi-annual revenue
      ( $395,117.00 ), within the second six months of operation, making for a
      $530,064.00 year in revenue.
