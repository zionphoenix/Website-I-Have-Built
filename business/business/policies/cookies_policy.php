			<h1 class="w3-large w3-text-white" style="background-color:#770000;"> COOKIES POLICY </h1>
			<p>
				Visiting the Lorday Business websites with your browser settings
				adjusted to accept cookies or using Lorday Business devices, mobile
				apps, or other software tells us that you want to use Lorday Business
				products & services & that you consent to our use of cookies &
				other technologies to provide them to you as described in this notice
				& in our Privacy Policy.
			</p>

			<h1 class="w3-large w3-light-grey">Cookies & How We Use Them</h1>
			<p>
				Cookies are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to
				enable our systems to recognise your device & to provide features
				such as My Account, & interest-based advertisements on other
				websites. Any reference to "sites" of Lorday Business includes our
				Lorday Business websites, devices, mobile apps or other software.
				Cookies allow you to take advantage of some of the essential features
				of Lorday Business. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our
				cookies, you will not be able to proceed to Checkout, or use any
				Lorday Business products & services that require you to Log In.
			</p>

			<h1 class="w3-large w3-light-grey">Cookies & Browser Settings</h1>
			<p>
				The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your
				browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify
				you when you receive a new cookie & how to disable cookies
				altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used
				by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-ons
				settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer.
			</p>

			<h1 class="w3-large w3-light-grey">Internet Advertisings</h1>
			<p>
				On certain Lorday Business-owned & operated sites & unaffiliated
				sites, Lorday Business displays interest-based advertising using
				information you make available to us when you interact with certain
				of our sites, content, or services. Interest-based ads, also sometimes
				referred to as personalised or targeted ads, are displayed to you
				based on information from activities such as purchasing on our sites,
				use of devices, apps or software, visiting sites that contain
				Lorday Business content or ads, interacting with Lorday Business tools or
				using our payment services, like Checkout by Lorday Business.
			</p>
			<p>
				Like other online ad networks, we use cookies, web beacons (also known
				as action tags or single-pixel gifs), & other technologies
				(collectively, "cookies"). Cookies enable us to learn about what ads
				you see, what ads you click, & other actions you take on our sites
				& other sites. This allows us to provide you with more useful &
				relevant ads. For example, if we know what ads you are shown we can
				be careful not to show you the same ones repeatedly.
			</p>
			<p>
				Lorday Business does not associate your interaction with unaffiliated
				sites with your identity in providing you with interest-based ads.
			</p>
			<p>
				Lorday Business does not provide any personal information to advertisers
				or to third party sites displaying interest-based ads. However,
				advertisers & other third-parties (including the ad networks,
				ad-serving companies, & other service providers they may use) may
				assume that users who interact with or click on a personalised ad or
				content are part of the group the ad or content is directed towards
				(for example, users in a particular geographical area or users who
				bought or browsed for classical music). Also, some third-parties may
				provide us information about you (such as demographic information or
				sites where you have been shown ads) from offline & online sources
				which we may use to provide more relevant & useful advertising.
			</p>
			<p>
				Third party advertisers or advertising companies working on their
				behalf sometimes use technology to serve the advertisements that
				appear on our sites directly to your browser. They automatically
				receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies
				to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements & to
				personalise advertising content. We do not have access to or control
				over cookies or other features that advertisers & third party sites
				may use, & the information practices of these advertisers & third
				party websites are not covered by our Privacy Policy or this Cookies
				Policy page. Please contact them directly for more information about
				their privacy practices.
			</p>

				If you have any questions about our Internet Advertising practices or
				options related to setting your preferences related to our practices,
